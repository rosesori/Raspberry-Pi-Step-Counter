# Raspberry-Pi-Step-Counter
Using an accelerometer sensor on a raspberry pi circuit, we can hold the device and detect the number of steps taken at 90% accuracy.
A team of 2, Kazuoki Tokuno and Rose Soriano took raw data from the accelerometer, interpolated the raw signals, and calculated peak values from the transformed signals to understand when "steps" were in the plotted data.

**Technology:** Raspberry Pi 3, MPU6050 chip, basic breadboard and wiring to complete a circuit through GPIO pins.
